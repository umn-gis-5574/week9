# week9 - Planning your website.

## But first
Let's talk about basemaps. How did your adventures go last week? Were you able to come up with a basemap? Maybe we should walk through the publishing process on Arc Server again? Should we take another week before reviewing?

## Content
Plan out sections of content that you'll need to create. Think along the lines of "introduction", "about us", "methods", "data", but also more project specific sections. Hammer out your sections, write them down, and assign a team member to be responsible for it. Rather than writing your own HTML, this is another case where I'd strongly suggest working in [Markdown](https://github.com/umn-gis-5574/syllabus/wiki/Markdown).

## Layout
Find some projects/websites you really like the layout of. Make some sketches as a group of what you'd like your site you look. If you want to avoid paper, use a wireframe editor (like [this](https://wireframe.cc/)). This goes for the general website as well as the web maps that will be part of it. For the web maps, talk about (and write down) what layers you have, how you want to present them, what other tools you want to give users, etc. Next week we'll talk more technically about layout and prototyping.
